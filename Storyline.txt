In a small village nestled in between the ocean and dense forest, the people were facing a great danger. 
A dark force had descended upon the land, bringing with it destruction and chaos. 
The villagers were afraid, and many had fled their homes in search of safety. 

As the days passed, the situation grew worse. The forest was dying, the crops were withering, and the animals were disappearing. 
The once-beautiful flowers wilted, the once-clear waters grew murky, and the once-gentle breeze grew harsh and cold. 
The villagers were desperate for a hero to save them from the darkness, but no one had come forward. 

One day, the ancient amulet hat had been passed down through generations in the village began to crack. 
The villagers were scared by its sudden change, as the amulet was said to be the source of the village's prosperity and well-being. 
It was said that the amulet had the power to restore the Village, but only if it was wielded by a chosen one. 

You see an old, cracked amulet and it draws you near. 
You touch the amulet, and it begins to emit a soft glow. 

Tiki speaking to chief:
The amulet glowed with a soft, golden light when *name* touched it. 
Chief Koa:
The amulet had found its chosen one. 
The island is the heart of the darkness. There you will face the source of the evil that has been threatening our village.  

Island character:
Mana: She is the care taker the person/island who lost the heart
Tells the rest of the story
The amulet was the heart of the ... 
Many years have passed since the heart was stolen( or borrowed but not returned)
The heart began to stop beating and cracking (losing its life force) as it had been so far away from its body.
Finally .... is at peace.
Thank you!!
